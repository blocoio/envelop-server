![Envelop - Share and upload private files easily](https://envelop.app/images/og-image.png)

Share private files easily, without losing their ownership.

With [Blockstack](https://blockstack.org), you decide where your files are stored.
Use the default storage (infinite space with a 25MB file limit), or setup your own storage.

## Features

- Upload a file (from the file browser or from other apps)
- Get a short URL to share, so other can download your file
- Delete files you no longer need or want to share

## Contributing
